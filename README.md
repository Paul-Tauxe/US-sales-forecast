# US-sales-forecast
This repository demonstrates my skills in data science and time series forecasting, using macroeconomic data from FRED-MD **to predict U.S. manufacturing and industry sales** over a 6-month horizon.

# Project Summary
The forecasting model is implemented in a single Jupyter notebook, which walks through:

* Loading and preprocessing macroeconomic data

* Computing factors for dimensionality reduction

* Selecting the number of factors using **Bai & Ng (2002)** criteria

* Training the forecasting model and generating predictions

# Files Included
`result_summary.png` – A single image summarizing the forecast results, demonstrating the model’s ability to predict trends effectively.

`forecasting_model.ipynb` – The full code notebook containing all data preparation, modeling, and forecasting steps.

The factor computation and selection section is adapted from code written by **Professor George Milunovich**, sourced from his GitHub repository `FactorModels`, and integrated into this notebook for reproducibility.

# Highlights

* Implements dynamic factor models for macroeconomic forecasting

* Integrates academic methods into real-world analysis

* Produces clear, interpretable forecast results from high-dimensional data

* Fully contained in one notebook for ease of review and reproducibility
